<i>Hiya! I'm writing you an email because I was planing to come to Paris to improve my French. I learnt it for five years in Germany where I live. One week ago I spent a week in Paris looking for a room or a flat to rent but unfortunately I couldn't find one as it was either too expensive or they wouldn't give it to me for three months. Can you maybe help me? I want to spend not more than 400 Euro for the rent. Do you know someone who lets rooms to students or do you have a room to rent yourself? I'm * years old, female and want to join a language school in Paris (Alliance francaise). You can see my profile online if you're interessted. I'd really love to live in Paris for three months and will be delighted to get any helping news from you! My email adress is: *@*.de Thx in advance, Sincerly *<br><br>

Hola. ... I know this club is not meant to ask for long-term stays, but I thought that wasn't a big deal to ask the question : at first in Barcelona, I'll be staying a couple of days at a friends'flat, while I'll be looking for an accomodation for my all stay. I know they are many dorms or building of flats with other students, and exchange students from all Europe, but as I've known such an experience already, I'm feeling to have another kind of experience. And I thought this site would provide good contacts. That's why I'm asking you if you, or someone you know, would have a room for me to stay the time I'll be in Barcelona. Of course for such a long stay, I'll be happy to pay for accomodation! I'm not looking for something totally free, just something else that the usual exchange student experience. ... The university where I go to is near Tibidabo, so I guess it's better for me to stay at a place with public transportation ... Regards, *, Belgica. ... <br><br>
... On the beginning of February I am comming to Surrey. I will an intern in Royal Botanic Garden, Kew. I am going to stay in UK till May. What I would like to ask you, is to help me to found an accomodation. I am looking for a room, not expencive and not far away from Kew. If you could send me some addresses or contact with an agency or something like that, it would be grate. Or maby do you know somebody, who is looking for a roommade? I know, what am I asking for is not easy, so If you are bussy I will understand. ...<br><br>
I'm * from Mannheim, Germany and I'm writing to you with a little
problem! I hope you can help me out. This is the deal: my boyfriend * will be studying at the CBS in Copenhagen soon. He'll come to your city in mid-August. Here comes the trouble: the International Office had at first told him that they will look for a room for him but now it's all full!! They said that he will have to look on his own. He's pretty worried because he has already looked for hours on the web and read everywhere that it's really really hard finding something in Copenhagen. And he doesn't speak any Danish, that doesn't help much either. Since I'm his girlfriend I just can't bear seeing him so concerned by that problem all the time, so I'm trying to help him the best I can. So here's my question: Do you have any information for him, or do you know anyone he could go to and ask for a room? Or anyone who's moving out, or a cheap hostel to stay at in the beginning..really any info is appreciated. He has tried some hostels already, but the affordable ones are all booked out already. I'm looking forward to your answer, and I hope you can help! Maybe you could forward this email to some friends? Thank you so much in advance. : )<br><br>

Hi *! I'm a * year old student from Germany. I will come to Glasgow in september to study there for half a year. I have a rather "strange" question: would you be ready to help me a bit with flathunting?? It's so hard to find a flat when you're not there personally. But I'm afraid that, when I'm coming (by the middle of september), everybody goes flathunting. So, you can contact me on *@*.de. I would be very grateful! Yours * <br><br>
Can you help me find accommodation with high speed internet access? Or maybe explain how the internet access works down there if I was going to stay temporarily and do not want to get a phone installed / registed under my name? I appreciate any help you can offer, Kindest regards, * from Canada

<i>Dear Sir/Ma/Family, May the blessing of the Almighty God be with the whole of this family. Probably by now you might be wondering who is it that is writing you this letter. Relax and be blessed it is a friend from the Hospitality Club. I joined the Club in * when I was surfing through the net if there is any friendly Organisation that links people of the world together except from all this dating stuffs. Alas, that was when I found and joined the Club and since then I have been trying to view profiles if I can get the ones of families or any person that I can trust and call a friend. You are the very first person or family I'm writing this letter to, therefore, let me start by introducing myself, my name is *, * years and a Nigerian. I have always been a victim of circumstances since I was born, I never knew my father until I was 21 years. Me and my mother were abandoned by my father since I was born. I've never knew how it's like to have a family or be shown a fatherly love. So I've always envied those who does.
The main reason why I'm writting this letter is to ask for your help or if there is any other person you can introduce me to who is in the position to help me. I've always have the dream of coming to the United States of America but I just don't have the means or the connection to do so. If you have been opportuned to watch and read foreign news you will know that Africa is a doomed Continent with no hope for the up-coming youths like us. Although Africa is blessed with so many resources, it is only the leaders and few individuals that enjoy the proceeds from these resources leaving millions of people impoverished, poor, helpless, useless and hopeless.
Nigeria my Country is not an exception, we are suffering, things are very hard, the whole system is up-side down from education, health, road, water, electricity to anything you can think off. There is no prospect and future for any youth in this country unless you find your way out of the country. Many young men and women who surpose to use their knowledge and talent to develop the Country are frustrated into doing all sorts of dirty things like armed-robbery, drug smuggling, prostitution and so on just for them and their family to survive. Or what would you say or a boy or girl who spends 7-8 years in Higher Institution for a course that is only surposed to last for 4 years because of unneccessary Strike action here and there. Imagine the stress and the drain this will have on the individual. Unfortunately for me I could not further than High shcool, but I went for a proficiency course in Computer Literacy because of my love for Computers.
Please I really need a change of enviroment and help. My mother is aging and very sick, at least I want to put a smile on her face for all she has gone through because of me before she dies. So I will be very happy if you can help me travel out of this Country and if you can help in anyway you can. I don't mind if it means paying you back when I get there and begin work.
Please help make my dream come true.
I'll be expecting your reply. Yours Faithfully, *</i><br>
(Not to make fun of the terrible situation in Africa, but to demonstrate the kind of letters that would be sent through the club without spam protection. Ah yes, and it is the same guy who sent "dating stuff" before himself!)

... I�m from Argentina but I have italian citizenship too. At this moment I�m in Malmoe (Sweden) trying to find a job, but I know that it�s impossible. I was living in Tenerife the last 8 months, but I wanted to try in Sweden, I�m here one week ago. But to get a job here if one doesn�t speak swedish is impossible. My english is an intermediate level, I need to improve it.
I thought in travel to London some days ago, but as I don�t know nobody there I was thinking in come back to Tenerife (I have an air-ticket for this sunday) but like I�m close to England, and I discovered this club through a member yesterday, maybe I would go to London if someone can help me some days (staying in your house)until a I get a room where to live. But the most important what I want to know if is easy to get a job (in pub, a restaurant,etc o whatever). Remember that I have italian passport. I will be very grateful if you could answer me. And of course excuse me for this asking Kindest regards *<br><br>

This spammer's behaviour was especially deceiving. He first signed up as a Country Volunteer, told us he would try to stop the annoying trend of people from Ghana using the HC as a visa agency and then did it himself (after sending tons of seemingly harmless messages to many HC members). Quotes from a message to us: <i>In respond to your mail,i am very grateful that i am considered for this position.I am not going to call myself ghana volunteer without an action to promote the club. ... In the matters of people using this club for visas from Ghana,i will try to act in a sensible way to curb this trend of affairs,and i hope it will gradually fade from Ghana.</i> And then a message to a member: <i>This is *,Ghana volunteer for Hospitality Club.In line with my intended visit,i am sending you this mail to inform you that i will be coming to you in April,2004 during my leave of absence.

<i>Dear *, Greetings from Ghana.My name is *,Ghana volunteer for Hospitality club.My student by name * is planning a trip to Italy next year and i am requesting,as a part of my service to the Hopitality club,as to whether you can host him,including meals. If you consider hosting him,please come back to him for visiting schedules.Find below his e-mail address; *@*.com. I hope that you will provide this assistance as a member of the club.<br><br>
Hello! I am writing to you, because two friends of mine will go to Nigeria. They'll be at Lagos at the 16./17. September. Afterwards they want to go to Abuja. Could you please give me some information about how they could travel from Lagos to Abuja? Or could you give some information about Lagos? What clothes will they need? Perhaps you could welcome them at the airport? My friends (* and *) live in New York ... I would be very happy to hearing from you soon!<br><br>
*, what about having a guest in late June or July? My daughter is Polish, just two years younger than you and she must improve her French for her planned studies, but I can't afford paying regular school PLUS accommodation. She speaks very good English, but only intermediate French.
She likes reading and music, just like you. She could share your rent and pay for food, but needs to stay longer (2+ weeks). How much money would she need for that? And what do you say to the idea? If it's OK, you can contact her at *@*.pl ... (she doesn't know I'm writing to you)<br><br>
